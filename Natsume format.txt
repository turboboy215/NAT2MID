There are two versions of the driver: the earlier "common" version which is used in the majority of games, and a later version with major differences. It is likely that music in the earlier version was written in MML, and music in the later version was converted from MIDI. The later version also makes use of bankswitching. The earlier version closely resembles the NES and Master System versions of the driver, whereas the later version closely resembles the GBA version.

Earlier/common version
============================================================================

Song pointer table
===================
The song pointer table is structured with 16-bit pointers to each song. Unfortunately, there doesn't appear to be a consistent method to look for the pointer to the table.

Channel headers
===================
The "header" for each song is structured as follows, with a 2-byte "mask" and pointers to each channel's sequence:
1 = Channel mask?
2 = ?
3-4 (x4) = Pointer to each channel

Sequence commands
===================
Each song channel's sequences are comprised of the following commands:
xy (00-BF?) = Play note, length
Cx = Rest, length
 0 = 25
 1 = 50
 2 = 75
 3 = 100
 4 = 125
 5 = 150
 6 = 175
 7 = 200
 8 = 225
 9 = 250
 A = 275
 B = 300
 C = 325
 D = 350
 E = 375
 F = 400
D0-D7 = Set octave (Higher value = lower octave, 5-7 = too low)
D8-DF = Set octave + transpose + 1 (Higher value = lower octave, D-F = too low)
E0-E5 xx = Noise effects?
E6-E8 (xx) = Set volume = also uses an additional byte in later games
E9 xx = Set up waveform
EA xx = Set echo
EB xx = Set envelope sweep
EC = Turn off "glide"
ED-EF = Set volume
F0 xx = Repeat the following notes X times (v1)
F1 = End of repeated pattern with F0 command
F2 xx xx = Go to loop point
F3 xx = Repeat the following notes X times (v2)
F4 = End of repeated pattern with F3 command
F5 xx xx = Go to macro
F6 = Return from macro
F7 xx = Sweep up
F8 xx = Sweep down
F9 xx yy = Set attack rate values?
FA xy = Set duty/envelope
FB xx yy zz aa = Set envelope parameters
FC = Turn on "glide" - notes are continuously played as if held down
FD xx = Set channel speed (more = slower)
FE xx = Set noise effect?
FF = End channel track

Later version
============================================================================

Song pointer table
===================
Same as the earlier version.

Channel headers
===================
The "header" for each song is structured as follows, with a 2-byte "mask" and pointers to each channel's sequence:
1 = Channel mask
2 = Priority?
3 = Bank
4-5 (x?) = Pointer to each channel

Sequence commands
===================
Each song channel's sequences are comprised of the following commands:
xx yy (X = 00-7F) = Play note, length
80 xx = Rest, length
xx yy (X = 81-CF) = Play note, length (duplicate of 00-7F?)
D0-DF = Set volume/attack rate
E0 xx = Set envelope size?
E1 xx = Stereo flag 1?
E2 xx = Stereo flag 2?
E3 xx = Set waveform
E4-E7 = Set duty
E8 xx = Transpose channel (signed)
E9 xx = Set echo
EA-EF = Set volume?
F0 xx = Repeat the following notes X times (v1)
F1 = End of repeated pattern with F0 command
F2 xx = Repeat the following notes X times (v2)
F3 = End of repeated pattern with F2 command
F4 xx xx = Go to loop point
F5 xx xx = Go to macro
F6 = Return from macro
F7 xx = Set sweep?
F8 xx = Set tuning
F9 xx yy = Set attack rate values?
FA xx = Set envelope?
FB xx yy zz aa = Set envelope parameters
FC = Turn on "glide" - notes are continuously played as if held down
FD = Turn off "glide"
FE xx = Set noise effect?
FF = End channel track
